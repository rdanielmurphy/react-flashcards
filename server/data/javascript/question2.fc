===QUESTION===
What is a potential pitfall with using typeof bar === 'object' to determine if bar is an object? How can this pitfall be avoided?

===ANSWER===
Although **typeof bar === 'object'** is a reliable way of checking if bar is an object, the surprising gotcha in JavaScript is that **null** is also considered an **object!**
