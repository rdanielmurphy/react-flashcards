===QUESTION===
What is the difference between inline, inline-block, and block?

===ANSWER===
## Inline elements:
* respect left & right margins and padding, but not top & bottom
* cannot have a width and height set
* allow other elements to sit to their left and right.

## Block elements:
* respect all of those
* force a line break after the block element

## Inline-block elements:
* allow other elements to sit to their left and right
* respect top & bottom margins and padding
* respect height and width
