===QUESTION===
What is NaN? What is its type? How can you reliably test if a value is equal to NaN?

===ANSWER===
The NaN property represents a value that is “not a number”. This special value results from an operation that could not be performed either because one of the operands was non-numeric **(e.g., 'abc' / 4)**, or because the result of the operation is non-numeric.
