===QUESTION===
var vs let vs const

===ANSWER===
**var** is function scope while **let** and **const** are block scope, which means any time youâ€™ve got a set of curly brackets you have block scope.

With let and consts, you can only declare a variable inside of its scope once.  With var you can declare the same variable more than once within the same scope.

const variable cannot be updated unless it's an object then it's properties can be updated.

Object.freeze is another way to make a variable immutable.
