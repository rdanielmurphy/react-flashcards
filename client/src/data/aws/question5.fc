===QUESTION===
What is it the name of the deployment strategy where when deploying an application to production, two separate, but identical, 
environments are created.  One live, and one a clone of the live environment.  And when the deployment of the clone is successful, 
the CI/CD pipeline then swaps the URLs between the two environments and terminates the original.

===ANSWER===
Blue-Green Deployment
